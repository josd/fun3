pause function-based resolution when not all variables have been bound
    this can be at any level or recursion
    builtin fn calls yield or whatever

lookup co-routining impl & translate to python...
don't know enough at this point

but, will translation still be like "regular" functions?

hmm, continuation game is maybe also not that common
    but, more in line with capabilities of other imp. langs??
**alternative: use (non-coroutine) generators & iterate over clause fn results
